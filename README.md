# Heatmap Calendar (with Seasons)

The heatmap calendar (with seasons) is a perfect homepage for your Obsidian setup. It tracks and displays your most productive and least productive days in a heatmap calendar. Some people might know it as GitHub style calendar.

> **Fun Fact:** The most productive color for a season is the least productive color for the next season. `"#66CC4E"` in the Winter/Spring Reset (Quarter 1) is the first color in the Summer Surge quarter (Quarter 2).

It requires Dataview and [Heatmap Calendar](https://github.com/Richardsl/heatmap-calendar-obsidian) for it work.

I have a lot of activities in a day, so my color palette is huge (10 colours), you can shorten it as per your preferences or use cases.

In `const activities = []`, you can edit the following:

- `source` = folder where your daily notes are saved
- `field` = name of the property (must be a checkbox)
- `emoji` = emoji you want to display for the activities
- `color` = can be anything (you can even reuse the colors)

You can change or modify the headers and other UI as per your likings.
